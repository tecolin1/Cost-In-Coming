   <FONT FACE="courier new"><center><h1>Cost Calculation</h1></center>
        
   The cost or cost is the economic expense that represents the manufacture of a product or the provision of a service. In determining the cost of production, you can set the sale price to the public of the good in question (the price to the public is the sum of the cost plus the profit). The cost of a product is formed by the price of the raw material, the price of the direct Labour employed in its production, the price of the indirect labour employed for the operation of the company and the cost of amortization of the machinery and the Indu Ios.

   Specialists say that many entrepreneurs often set their sales prices on the basis of competitors ' prices, without first determining whether they are likely to cover their own costs. Therefore, a large number of businesses do not prosper because they do not get the necessary profitability for their operation. This reflects that the calculation of the costs is indispensable for the correct business management.

   The analysis of business costs allows us to know what, where, when, to what extent, how and why it happened, which enables better management of the future.

   In other words, the cost is the economic effort that must be made to achieve an operational objective (payment of wages, purchase of materials, manufacture of a product, funding for financing, management of the company, etc.). When the desired target is not reached, a company is said to have losses.<br/>

    <FONT SIZE=4.5>Production Costs (also called operating costs) are the costs required to maintain a project, processing line, or operating equipment. In a standard company, the difference between income (for sales and other inputs) and production cost indicates gross profit.
        
    <p>Production Cost = Prime Cost + Direct Manufacturing Overhead + indirect Costs.</p><br/>  
    
    <FONT FACE="courier new"><center><h2>Indirect Costs</h2></center>
    
    The indirect Cost is one of the types of costs that affects the production process of one or more products that the company sells later. But What really characterizes these costs is that they cannot be allocated directly to each of the products. I mean, if you produce cars, you know that in every car, you'll need as raw material, 4 wheels, for example. However, this is not possible with indirect costs. It will Be done only after having defined a coherent allocation criterion, which allows you to calculate your assignment to each product individually, which will guide you later when defining the final price of sale.
       
    <p>Indirect Costs = Indirect Raw Material + indirect Labor + indirect Manufacturing Overhead.</p><br/>
        
    <FONT FACE="courier new"><center><h2>Distribution Costs</h2></center>
        
    The distribution costs are all the disbursements in which a producer incurs to get his products, from their manufacturing plant to the place where they are acquired, thus constituting a fundamental component of the total cost to the producer and the Price paid by consumers, therefore their analysis is of great importance in terms of business efficiency.
        
    <p>Distrubucion Costs = Sales costs + Administration Expenses</p> <br/>
        
        
    <FONT FACE="courier new"><center><h2>Operating Costs</h2></center>
    
    The notion of operating expenses refers to the money disbursed by a company or organization in the development of its activities. Operating expenses are salaries, rental of premises, purchase of supplies and others.
    
    In other words, operating expenses are those intended to maintain an asset in its existing condition or to modify it so that it will be in proper working condition again.

    Operating Expenses may be divided into administrative expenses (salaries, Office services), financial (interest, issuance of checks), sunk expenses (made before the commencement of operations inherent to the activities) and expenses of Representation (gifts, trips, meals).

    Operating Expenses are also known as indirect expenses, as they are those expenses related to the operation of the business but are not investments (such as buying a machine).

    Let us Remember that, in the economic sense, an investment is the placing of capital that is made to achieve a future profit. Investment implies the resignation of an immediate benefit for a future.
        
    The Operating Expenses, instead, are destined to the operation of the business and do not materialize in the hope of a future benefit, but its function is to allow the subsistence of the commercial activity (which, of course, is intended to be profitable and to make profit) .

    For Example: The purchase of five computers by a company is an investment. However, daily spending on printing cartridges, sheets and electricity is part of the operating expenses.

    <p>Total Cost of Operation = Production Cost + Distribution Cost.</p><br/>
